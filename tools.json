    "desc": "A DDoS attack, or Distributed Denial-of-Service attack, is a cybercrime that involves flooding a target with internet traffic to make it inaccessible. DDoS attacks are a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack, but they are far more powerful than traditional DoS because they use multiple sources to generate exponentially more traffic.\n\nThis information is part of a series of articles focused on anti-DDoS.\n\nDDoS attacks are typically launched from a botnet, which is a network of compromised devices. This also increases the difficulty of attribution, as the true source of the attack is harder to identify.\n\nThe goal of a DDoS attack is to overwhelm a system's resources or bandwidth, making it difficult or impossible for legitimate traffic to reach its destination. DDoS attacks can have a number of consequences, including lost business, reputation damage, and a drop in legitimate traffic.",
